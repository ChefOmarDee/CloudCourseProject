  # Step 1: Build Docker image from the server folder
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      [
        "build",
        "-t",

  # Step 2: Push Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR)
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args: ["push", "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/myapp:$COMMIT_SHA"]

  # Step 3: Deploy to Cloud Run
  - name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud"
    args:
      - "run"
      - "deploy"
      - "${_SERVICE_NAME}" # Dynamic service name based on branch

      - "--region=us-central1"
      - "--platform=managed"
      - "--allow-unauthenticated"

# Dynamically set the service name based on the branch
